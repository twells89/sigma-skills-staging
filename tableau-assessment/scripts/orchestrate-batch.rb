# Plan a bulk Tableau→Sigma conversion batch from migration-plan.json.
# This script doesn't itself spawn subagents — subagent spawning happens at
# the agent's conversation layer via the Agent tool. This script produces:
#
#   1. A respecting-DM-clusters execution plan as `batch-plan.json`:
#      - For each cluster: a "leader" workbook that builds the cluster's DM
#        (Phase 1-4 from scratch) and N "follower" workbooks that reuse the
#        leader's DM via Phase 1.5 (find-or-pick-dm.rb).
#      - Leaders run first, sequentially within a cluster but in parallel
#        across clusters. Followers run in parallel once their leader is done.
#      - Concurrency cap: --concurrent (default 3) controls how many
#        subagents the conversation-layer fires in any single message-batch.
#
#   2. The exact agent briefs (markdown) the conversation-layer should pass
#      into each Agent(subagent_type='general-purpose') call.
#
#   3. An empty `batch-results.json` skeleton the conversation-layer fills
#      in as each subagent completes (workbookId → status / sigma_url /
#      parity_tier / duration_s / errors).
#
# Aggregate semantics (continue-on-failure):
#   - GREEN: workbook posted clean (0 column-errors, verify-workbook.rb clean)
#            AND all chart actuals strict-PASS (or PASS in extract-mode).
#   - YELLOW: workbook posted clean BUT one or more charts diverge in values.
#            Structural conversion succeeded; needs human review.
#   - RED: column-type errors, POST failure, verify failure, or no actuals.
#

    Convert one Tableau workbook to Sigma using the tableau-to-sigma skill.

    WORKBOOK
    - name:       #{wb['name']}
    - workbookId: #{wb['workbookId']}
    - priority:   #{wb['priority_tier']}

    SKILL: ~/.claude/skills/tableau-to-sigma/  (read SKILL.md fully)

    #{override_block}#{reuse ? <<~REUSE : <<~LEAD}
      DM REUSE — your cluster leader has already built/picked the DM. Read
      `#{leader_dm_id_path}` for `{ dataModelId, fact_element_id, denorm_plan_path }`.
      Skip Phase 2 + 3 entirely. In Phase 4, source your workbook's master
      table(s) using the leader's DM. Use the denorm plan at `denorm_plan_path`
      verbatim — direct refs for `location:fact`, Lookup formulas for
      `location:dim`. This is the dd7 preflight pattern.
    REUSE

      DM LEAD — your cluster's first workbook. You'll either:
      (a) find a reusable DM in this org via Phase 1.5 picker, then run
          Phase 1.5b inspect-dm-shape.rb on it, OR
      (b) build a new DM (Phases 2-4) sourcing from these shared warehouse
          tables: #{shared_tables.inspect}
      Once your DM is determined, WRITE `#{leader_dm_id_path}` with
      `{ dataModelId, fact_element_id, fact_element_name, denorm_plan_path }`
      so followers can reuse it. If you ran inspect-dm-shape.rb, that's the
      denorm_plan_path.

      **`fact_element_name` MUST be the live name on the DM**, not whatever
      you originally wrote in your spec. After POSTing the DM (or after
      Phase 1.5 picks one), you MUST introspect via:
        GET /v2/dataModels/<dataModelId>/spec
      and read the actual `name` attribute on your chosen fact element.
      Audit-run-1 (Orders cluster) had a leader write `fact_element_name: "Fact"`
      when the live element was `ORDER_FACT` — its follower had to GET the
      leader's workbook spec to recover, costing ~2 min. Don't repeat that:
      the GET-and-record step is cheap and mandatory.
    LEAD

    >>>>>> CRITICAL — VISUAL FIDELITY REQUIREMENT <<<<<<

    You MUST treat the source dashboard PNGs as ground truth — CSV column
    parity alone has shipped customer-visible visual regressions (heatmaps
    rendered as bar charts, log scales silently dropped, missing annotations).

    BEFORE writing any workbook spec:
    1. Read every per-sheet PNG at `<out-dir>/<wb-dir>/views-png/*.png`
       OR `/tmp/#{wb_dir_hint}/views/*.png` via the Read tool. Expected
       count: #{png_count_str}. If the directory is empty, fall back to
       `mcp__tableau__get-view-image` per view (one solo request at a time —
       parallel requests 401).
    2. For each PNG, decide: chart kind, dual-axis vs single, annotations,
       data labels, axis scale (log vs linear), reference lines, palette.
    3. **LAYOUT COMPOSITION** — the dashboard PNG (named like
       `Dashboard*`, `*Overview*`, or whichever zone is the largest /
       multi-element) tells you the GRID. Count its columns and rows of
       tiles. Read the .twb zone tree at `<out-dir>/twbs/<luid>.twb` or
       use `scripts/parse-twb-layout.rb` for per-tile `x_pct, y_pct,
       w_pct, h_pct` — translate those into 24-column / multi-row
       `<LayoutElement>` positions. A 3-column × 2-row source dashboard
       MUST become a 3-column × 2-row Sigma layout, NOT a single-column
       stack. Single-column layouts are the most common visual regression
       across audit batches — every chart at `gridColumn="1 / 13"` is
       almost always wrong unless the source PNG also stacks vertically.

    AFTER workbook PUT, BEFORE declaring GREEN:
    4. POST `/v2/workbooks/{wb}/export` with body
       `{pageId, format: {type: "png", pixelWidth: 1920, pixelHeight: 1500}}`,
       then poll `GET /v2/query/{q}/download` until content-type is image/png.
       Save the bytes to `<out-dir>/<wb-dir>/sigma-render.png`.
    5. Read `sigma-render.png` via the Read tool and visually compare it
       to each source PNG you read in step 1. The comparison MUST check
       both (a) per-chart fidelity (chart kind, axis values, color, labels)
       AND (b) **whole-dashboard composition** — does the Sigma render
       have the same number of tile columns and rows as the source
       dashboard PNG? If the source is a 3×2 grid and Sigma renders a
       single tall column with the right half empty, that's a layout
       failure — downgrade to YELLOW with `error_summary` noting the
       grid mismatch, even if every individual chart value matches.
       If a tile is missing entirely, RED. If proportions/positions
       diverge by more than ~25% of grid width, YELLOW.
    6. The result line MUST include `screenshot_path: "<absolute path>"`.
       GREEN tier is INVALID without a non-null screenshot_path AND
       composition match.

    SUBSTITUTIONS for unsupported Tableau chart types (when source PNG
    shows one of these, render the listed Sigma equivalent and note the
    substitution in error_summary):
      - treemap                       → donut-chart
      - heatmap (1D color matrix)     → pivot-table with rowsBy + columnsBy +
                                        divergent backgroundScale on values
      - point-map without lat/long    → bar / region-map (by region code)
      - packed-bubble                 → bar-chart (sized by measure)
      - density / contour             → scatter-plot with binning

    PERF
    - Fire all `mcp__tableau__get-view-data` calls in ONE parallel batch.
    - Use `find-or-pick-dm.rb --auto-pick` to skip the UX prompt.
    - Run `verify-workbook.rb`, NOT the deprecated .sh.
    - Fetch chart actuals via `mcp__sigma-mcp-v2__query` in one parallel batch.
    - Source `phase-timer.sh` and write phase-timings.json to your working dir.
    - Column discovery: use `scripts/discover-columns.rb --connection-id <id>
      --table-path <db>.<schema>.<table>` (Sigma REST, warehouse-agnostic),
      NOT a warehouse-specific CLI like `snow sql DESCRIBE TABLE`. The same
      script works against any Sigma-supported warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery,
      Databricks, Postgres, etc.). If it 404s, the table isn't in Sigma's
      catalog — fall back to Custom SQL per SKILL.md Phase 1e.1.

    >>>>>> SPEC-SHAPE GOTCHAS — pre-warning <<<<<<

    These seven shapes keep getting relearned at runtime across audit batches.
    Bake them into your spec from the first POST attempt — do NOT discover
    them by HTTP 400.

    - bar/line/area/scatter/combo `yAxis: { columnIds: [<id>, ...] }` —
      a single object whose `columnIds` is an array. NOT a bare array
      (`yAxis: [<id>]`) and NOT `yAxis: { columnId: ... }`.
    - chart `color: { by: "category" | "scale", column: <id> }`. NOT
      `{ columnId: <id> }`. `by` is required; `column` (singular) names the
      column ID.
    - `region-map` geography: `region: { id: <col-id>, regionType: "us-state" }`.
      NOT `geography: ...`. Valid regionTypes: `us-state`, `us-county`,
      `us-zipcode` (NOT `us-zip`), `us-cbsa` (NOT `us-msa`), `country`.
    - sort direction: `direction: "ascending" | "descending"` — full words.
      `asc` / `desc` are silently dropped and the chart renders unsorted.
    - DM relationships: `keys: [{ columnA: <id>, columnB: <id> }, ...]`.
      NOT `joinColumns: [...]`. The keys live on the source element, not the
      target.
    - Lookup formulas reference **column DISPLAY names**, not column IDs:
      `Lookup([Other_DM/Customer Name], [Master/Customer Key], [Other_DM/Customer Key])`.
      Element-name then slash then human-readable column name (the `name`
      field, never the `id` field). Cross-element refs inside a DM use
      `[BaseElement/REL_NAME/Field]`.
    - pivot-table value/dim shapes are NOT symmetric:
        values:    [<bare-id-string>, ...]          # array of strings
        rowsBy:    [{ id: <col-id> }, ...]          # array of objects
        columnsBy: [{ id: <col-id> }, ...]          # array of objects
      Mixing these (`values: [{id: ...}]` or `rowsBy: ["..."]`) silently
      renders an empty pivot. Verified 2026-05-24.
    - pivot-table / table `conditionalFormats[].columnIds` — NOT `columns`.
      The first POST in audit-run-1 (NASA agent) failed because the
      staging workbook-layout.md showed `columns`; the live API requires
      `columnIds`. Verified 2026-05-24.

    >>>>>> PHASE 6 IS MANDATORY — HARD GATE <<<<<<

    Phase 6 (parity verification) is the single most commonly-skipped step
    in subagent runs — beads-sigma-4pm. To prevent silent skips:

    1. Run `ruby scripts/phase6-parity.rb --tableau /tmp/<wb-dir> --workbook-id <id>`
       (Pass 1 builds the plan).
    2. Fire the listed MCP queries in ONE parallel batch, collect actuals,
       write `/tmp/<wb-dir>/parity-actuals.json`.
    3. Re-run with `--finalize --actuals ...` (Pass 2). This writes
       `/tmp/<wb-dir>/parity-final.json` — the sentinel the hard gate checks.
    4. **If you POSTed the workbook more than once** during spec iteration
       (each post-and-readback.rb invocation creates a NEW workbook — POST
       is create-only), run:
       `ruby scripts/cleanup-orphan-workbooks.rb --workdir /tmp/<wb-dir>`
       to delete the orphans. This MUST run before step 6 or the gate
       will fail with exit 4. See beads-sigma-38a.
    5. **Apply the layout** (MANDATORY — beads-sigma-bw3 — CoCo regression
       where elements rendered as a single-column stack):
       `ruby scripts/build-dashboard-layout.rb --layout /tmp/<wb-dir>/dashboard-layout.json --wb-ids /tmp/<wb-dir>/wb-ids.json --out /tmp/<wb-dir>/layout.xml`
       `ruby scripts/put-layout.rb --workbook <id> --layout /tmp/<wb-dir>/layout.xml`
       Skipping this step means the workbook PUTs without a top-level
       layout and Sigma renders every tile in a single column — exit 6
       on the gate. ALSO: KPI tiles (Tableau scorecards — mark=Text with
       one measure and no dims) now auto-emit as Sigma kpi-chart from
       parse-twb-layout; verify they appear in the readback before
       running the layout script.
    6. **MANDATORY FINAL STEP — before writing the result line, run:**
       `ruby scripts/assert-phase6-ran.rb --tableau /tmp/<wb-dir>`
       The gate checks FOUR things: Phase 6 ran, no orphan workbooks
       remain, no live column has type=error, and a layout XML is
       applied. Exit 0 → write GREEN if all other gates pass. Any
       non-zero exit → you MUST downgrade to YELLOW (parity skipped/
       incomplete, orphans uncleaned, runtime errors, layout missing)
       or RED (parity failed). Do NOT declare GREEN if assert-phase6-ran.rb
       did not exit 0. There is no exception.

    **If MCP query fails mid-Phase-6 with an auth-related error**, the
    Sigma MCP session has staled. Re-call `mcp__sigma-mcp-v2__begin_session`
    and retry the query. Do NOT skip Phase 6 because of a recoverable
    auth error — that's the 2026-05-22 cluster-follower regression.

    **POST vs PUT for spec updates.** `POST /v2/workbooks/spec` is
    create-only. After your first successful POST, every spec update
    MUST be a `PUT /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec` against the same ID. Re-POSTing
    creates a duplicate workbook in the customer's My Documents — exactly
    the 2026-05-28 regression that left three workbooks behind. post-and-
    readback.rb now logs every POST to posted-workbooks.jsonl and prints
    a loud warning on second+ invocation.

    DELIVERABLES on completion — APPEND ONE LINE to `#{batch_results_path}`
    as JSON (newline-delimited; tolerate races with file locking):
      { workbookId, cluster_id: "#{sub['cluster_id']}", role: "#{reuse ? 'follower' : 'leader'}",
        sigma_workbook_url, sigma_workbook_id, dm_id_used,
        parity_tier: "GREEN" | "YELLOW" | "RED",
        column_errors: <int>, verify_status: "clean" | "fail",
        charts_pass: <int>, charts_total: <int>,
        phase6_assert_exit: <0|1|2|3>,        # MANDATORY — must be present
        screenshot_path: "<absolute path to sigma-render.png>" | null,
        duration_s: <float>, error_summary: <string|null> }

    PARITY TIER RULES
    - GREEN: column_errors==0 AND verify=="clean" AND charts_total > 0 AND
             charts_pass==charts_total AND phase6_assert_exit==0 AND
             screenshot_path != null AND you Read-back the Sigma PNG and
             confirmed visual parity with the source dashboard PNG(s).
             (charts_total==0 is NOT GREEN — that's the historic loophole;
             assert-phase6-ran.rb already rejects it.)
    - YELLOW: workbook posted clean BUT (charts_pass<charts_total OR
              phase6_assert_exit != 0 OR visual divergence noted in
              error_summary)
    - RED: any column_error OR verify=="fail" OR POST failure OR
           screenshot_path is null (couldn't render the Sigma workbook)

    CONTINUE-ON-FAILURE — if you hit a hard blocker (POST rejects, column-type
    error you can't resolve in 2 retry attempts, etc.), file a beads ticket
    via `bd create` and write a RED result line. Do not block other workbooks.

    Do NOT push any code changes.
